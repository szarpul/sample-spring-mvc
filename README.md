Main goal of this project is to show basic Spring MVC features in action.
You can find here some basic examples of how to use:
 - multiple Spring MVC servlets
 - controllers: path variables, request params, response body 
 - resource resolvers
 - interceptors
 - exception handling
 - controllers in combination with template engines such as jsp or freemarker
and many others.
